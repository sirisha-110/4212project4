                       having children and raising them, retiring, and whatever else happens post-retirement. 
                       We develop life long and shorter projects that define our life in terms of years, months, weeks, and days. In all this, 
                    we allocate time and other resources to activities and interactions with other people that evolve over time and space.

                <p style="font-size: 20px;">AThe climate of Greenland is Arctic, modified only
                    by the slight influence of the Gulf Stream in the southwest. 
                   Rapid weather changes, from sunshine to impenetrable blizzards, 
                   are common and result from the eastward progression of low-pressure air masses over a permanent layer 
                   of cold air above the island’s icy interior. Average winter (January) temperatures range from
                    the low 20s F (about −7 °C) 
                   in the south to approximately −30 °F (about −34 °C) in the north. 
                   Summer temperatures along the southwestern coast average in 
                   the mid-40s F (about 7 °C) during July,
                    while the average in the far north is closer to 40 °F (about 4 °C).</p>
